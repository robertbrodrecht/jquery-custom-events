jQuery Custom Events
====================

This is a collection of custom events (resizeStart, resizeEnd, scrollStart, and scrollEnd as of now) that are better to use than their continuously updating counterparts (resize and scroll).  I adapted the code from jQuery UI's scrollStart/scrollEnd, but largely rewrote it to do what I wanted (i.e. it appears jQUI's scrollStop required scrollStart to be attached, which didn't allow for scrollStop only events).

If you have any feedback, feel free to leave it here.
